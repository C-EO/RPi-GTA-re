## re3 (GTA 3) and reVC (GTA VC) compiled for the RPi i.e., armhf and arm64


I am not the creator of any of the above games:
  - re3 and reVC are created by [GTAmodding](https://github.com/GTAmodding) and archived by me.
    - More info (also source code) about re3 can be found [here](https://github.com/Jai-JAP/re-GTA/tree/re3/) (archived mirror)
    - More info (also source code) about reVC can be found [here](https://github.com/Jai-JAP/re-GTA/tree/reVC/) (archived mirror)
  
  - requires PC game assets to work, so you must own a copy of GTA.
  
  
  
# This project does not support or encourage any kind of piracy in any form.
  
  
  
# These downloadable builds of re3 and reVC do not contain any game data. You must own a copy of GTA 3 (or) GTA VC to be able to play the game(s).
  
  
  - This is only the engine. To play the game, you must provide/copy ALL the folders of your copy of the game inside the install path.
  - Any kind of pirated gamedata is not supported
  - To play the game go to your installation folder and run ./re3 (or) ./reVC
